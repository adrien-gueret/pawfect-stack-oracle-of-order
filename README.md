You are a witch. Not the greatest one of all, far from it! You're just an apprentice — everyone has to start somewhere. Your master has asked you to tidy up his cellar in order to channel all the magic as efficiently as possible. Sounds easy enough, right? But that's without taking into account your master's pet cat, who has plenty to say about it… and seems quite determined to get in your way.

## Oracle of Chaos

You are a cat. Probably the most beautiful one of all, let's be honest. But today, you're worried. Your human has taken on a young witch to tidy up his cellar. And you don't like that one bit! As a proper cat, you'll do everything in your power to make her life difficult. Sounds easy enough, right? But that's without taking into account the little witch, who won't let herself be pushed around — and she's got more than a few magic tricks up her sleeve…

## About items...

In both games, you'll have to handle some magical items. Some of them have some specificites:

Very fragile. If another item falls on it, or if it falls by itself, it will break.
  
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/order-205d61.svg" alt="Oracle of Order" /> Place your potions carefully so nothing can fall on them.<br>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/chaos-a0302d.svg" alt="Oracle of Chaos" /> Drop other items onto these potions... or push them into the void!  

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637b6bc0-72d6-48af-ba7f-e5da5ef5324e" /> Grimories

The more grimoires are placed next to each other, the higher their magic score will be.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/chaos-a0302d.svg" alt="Oracle of Chaos" /> Try to keep grimoires apart.

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc6b067-2e2b-4eef-bae9-512f2c04024e" /> Dried plant

Needs water. When watered, it will grow if there’s enough space, increasing its magic score.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/order-205d61.svg" alt="Oracle of Order" /> Water them as soon as there’s space so they can grow!<br>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/chaos-a0302d.svg" alt="Oracle of Chaos" /> Block them to stop them from growing as they should!
