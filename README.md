You are a witch. Not the greatest one of all, far from it! You're just an apprentice — everyone has to start somewhere. Your master has asked you to tidy up his cellar in order to channel all the magic as efficiently as possible. Sounds easy enough, right? But that's without taking into account your master's pet cat, who has plenty to say about it… and seems quite determined to get in your way.

## About items...

In this game, you’ll have to deal with magical items. Some of them have special properties:

Very fragile. If another item falls on it, or if it falls by itself, it will break.  
Place your potions carefully so nothing can fall on them.

The more grimoires are placed next to each other, the higher their magic score will be.  
Try to place grimoires next to each other.

Needs water. When watered, it will grow if there’s enough space, increasing its magic score.  
Water them as soon as there’s space so they can grow!

## Spells

The witch can cast spells to aid her in her task.  
When starting a level, each spell costs 0 magic. This cost increases after each use (but is capped at 5).

Rotate **all** items in the reserve 90° to the left or right. Useful for optimizing space when tidying up items.

Cast this spell on the cat to make it run.
Maybe casting it on a dried plant will do something…

Destroy any item in the cellar. This spell is meant to get rid of the cat’s junk, but you can also remove your Master’s items if needed.
